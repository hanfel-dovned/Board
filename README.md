`%board` is an Urbit app that allows you to modify a region of HTML on a shared bulletin board, based on [Robin Sloan's Spring '83 concept](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/specifying-spring-83/).

Upon installation, you'll be following your %pals. You can also manually follow or unfollow people using the form at the bottom of the page.

Install via ~ridlyd via Urbit sofware distribution, or manually via the desk in this repo.
